    STARTING THE PROJECT: OMNIFOOD

    ______________________________________

    1. 
        Goals: show what Omnifood do, how it works, where does it operates. Then, make people sign up on a subscription plan

        Audience: busy people who don't have time to cook or don't like it.
    
    2.  
        One-page navigation style, with every info

        Content: provided by Omnifood in text or images

        Navigation: also provided by Omnifood in a doc

    3. 
        Inspire yourself and draw the ideas of how your website will be.
        Remember: these are just ideas

    4.
        Design and develop your page

        As for design, choose the best colors and fonts
    
    5. 
        Separate your files into folders to organize your project. 

    6.
        Use Normalize.css to make the files render more consistently and in line to modern standards

    7.
        Build a responsive website that works on any device and with any screen resolution (mobile and desktop users)
    
    8.
        download the css grid code from responsives grids, this way your website will try to fit in any resolution

    9.
        Use the site Flat UI Colors to grab colors that looks good on the website

    10.
        Use media queries and breakpoints (screen width) to make the website responsive (visible across all devices)

        NOTE: we are gonna use breakpoints in the most commens widths out there but when we get more pro at it, we gonna want to use a breakpoint when our webpage looks terrible.

    11.

        After making the website, test it in multiple browsers 'cause every browser is differnet form one another.

        CSS Browsers Prefixes
        .Android: -webkit-
        .Chrome: -webkit-
        .iOS: -webkit-
        .Safari: -webkit-
        .Firefox: -moz-
        .IE: -ms-
        .Opera: -o-

        Use the autoprefixer extesion for this

    12. 
        Using jQuery

        Most popular js script
        free
        makes easier to manipulate HTML elements, create animations and develop ajax apps
        usage of plugins to extends it's power

        EG: we can create google maps app, youtube app, a image zoomer app, etc etc

        To use it, go to the google hosted libraries

    13.
        Used in this project, jQuery plugin 'waypoints', used to call a fucntion when we scroll the screen
    
    14.
        still on jQuery, we can grab snippets on google. basically, code that is already done that we can use
    
    15.
        Try to downgrade the size of your images, taking in consideration the high res machines.
        Use optimizilla for this also.

    16. 
        Also, we can minify the css code to delete white space.

    17.
        Search engine optimization (SEO)
        Optimze how the website will show in the search engines like google etc 
        we use the <meta> tag in the HTML for this

    18. 
        Valid HTML - use a website to validate your website (validatorw3)
        used to check if our HTML code does not have any bugs

    19.
        Launching the website in the wild

        .choose and buy a domain name (in this project - www.omnifood.com)
        .buy a web hosting to host it
        .upload the website

        in the lecture, godaddy.com was used to buy the domain and host
